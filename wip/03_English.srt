1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,290
All right, Thank you, James.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,690
Okay, Let's pivot a bit to talk about

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,825
Cloud services through the lens of sales.

4
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:11,235
The level set.

5
00:00:11,235 --> 00:00:13,260
Again, let's talk about what we mean

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,345
when we say Red Hat Cloud services.

7
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:17,460
Red Hat Cloud services is divided

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,280
into three different segments,

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,115
platform, application and data services.

10
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:27,300
Platform services are OpenShift Dedicated,

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,965
Rosa, ARO and OSE,

12
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:31,290
also known as managed OpenShift.

13
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,420
Application services,

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,940
are our API Management Kafka

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,970
and service strategy projects

16
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,490
with her via higher or dev level layers

17
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,705
of abstraction for,

18
00:00:41,705 --> 00:00:43,220
for our customers to build

19
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,620
new applications and modernize existing.

20
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,345
And finally data services,

21
00:00:47,345 --> 00:00:49,940
roads and Rohde wishes are data science

22
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,845
and data access broker products, respectively.

23
00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:57,155
We're going to talk mostly

24
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:58,820
about Rosa here
in a few moments,

25
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,590
but just again to level set,

26
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,210
this is the full
breadth and depth of

27
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,280
our Cloud services portfolio,

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,320
which is really helps

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,735
her support our
customers and their,

30
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,785
and their journeys
to be cloud native.

31
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:15,620
All right, so why does read as

32
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,280
sales love run at
Cloud services?

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,550
Well, the nice thing
about our Cloud services,

34
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,365
especially ARO and Rosa,

35
00:01:24,365 --> 00:01:26,360
and allows us to so with

36
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,820
the Cloud providers
rather than a guest,

37
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,410
the Cloud providers, and that

38
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,450
removes a ton of our friction.

39
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,330
Ton of friction between our
companies allows us to tap

40
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,290
into the enormous sales
and delivery teams.

41
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,780
These Cloud providers
have an unlocks a heck

42
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,860
of a lot more addressable

43
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,035
market and we can
get on our own.

44
00:01:45,035 --> 00:01:48,590
Arvin said in the
previous session,

45
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,580
that we are not at war
with hyperscalers,

46
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,870
but they are in fact a friend.

47
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,235
This is exactly what we mean.

48
00:01:55,235 --> 00:01:56,930
This has made all possible

49
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,889
because really the Cloud
services providers

50
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:05,110
have trained our customers

51
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,935
where they are today and
train them around technical.

52
00:02:08,935 --> 00:02:11,050
Basically, you know, how easy is

53
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,119
it to get access and
turn on resiliency,

54
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:15,355
availability scale,
they all LEDs, right?

55
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:16,930
And financial in terms

56
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,140
of a way to buy just what
they need at the time.

57
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,110
Just in time it's single
bill makes it super,

58
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,020
super easy for procurement.

59
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,290
So let's pivot to talk
about AWS, right?

60
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,050
Specifically selling with them
rather than against them.

61
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,910
And this is simply
because if you

62
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,070
look at our all of our
deployments for OpenShift,

63
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,530
for that matter, AWS makes
up about 20 percent of them.

64
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,120
So they are by far

65
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,175
the number one hyperscaler which

66
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:45,055
OpenShift is in
fact deploy, right?

67
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:47,260
And so let's talk about Rosa,

68
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,200
which is Red Hat
OpenShift service on AWS.

69
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,840
This is our native first-party
service that exist on

70
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,775
AWS that customers can buy
and transact through Amazon,

71
00:02:57,775 --> 00:02:59,695
through the console, right?

72
00:02:59,695 --> 00:03:02,440
So Rosa is specifically

73
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,750
a Cloud native experience
that they get.

74
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,580
So they get that
OpenShift experience that

75
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,610
developers and operators
love in Amazon.

76
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,545
As easy as they've
ever had before.

77
00:03:11,545 --> 00:03:12,205
All right?

78
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:15,670
And this is important, my seat
experience because one of

79
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,620
the greatest value
propositions of

80
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,800
OpenShift is that there's
a consistent experience,

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,490
really no matter where you
run, especially for workloads.

82
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,320
So it really helps bolster from

83
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,465
a technical perspective
the, the hybrid story,

84
00:03:29,465 --> 00:03:30,650
while we are abstracting

85
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,210
away the underlying
complexity of

86
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,590
the Cloud providers and

87
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,360
even hybrid on-prem
infrastructure.

88
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,395
Right?

89
00:03:36,395 --> 00:03:38,090
Back in a past life,

90
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,800
I lead a bunch of
development teams and one of

91
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,720
the most expensive
things that a deal with,

92
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,180
having different teams really

93
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,220
focusing on different
environments or stacks.

94
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,320
And so they really weren't
fungible with each other.

95
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,000
Something like
OpenShift specifically,

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,600
Rosa technically
allows me to have

97
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,400
a consistent
experience no matter

98
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,280
where where where were right.

99
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,010
Right. And then also
specific to Rosa,

100
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,750
which is much different than the

101
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,360
typical self-manage OpenShift
experience, is that,

102
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,640
you know, we're
meeting customers and

103
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,040
what they expect from technical
experience of having,

104
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,160
you know, a cluster up with
a few clicks as possible.

105
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,710
And we've made huge
improvements on this.

106
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,720
And Rosa, and we're

107
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,490
making even more so
in the future, right?

108
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,840
So we put at their fingertips.

109
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,590
So the, the burden of adoption,

110
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,855
of barriers and adoption
are much lower.

111
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:28,760
On the financial side of it,

112
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,790
It's really important not
the all Rosa consumption

113
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,175
retires the Cloud provider

114
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,680
or the commitments made to
the Cloud providers, right?

115
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,290
In Amazon's with respect
to w ADP, right?

116
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,235
That means, is it that our
customers have triggered there

117
00:04:43,235 --> 00:04:47,360
are some sign these very
large commitments that said,

118
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,875
I'm going to spend this much
money on your platform.

119
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,270
You're going to get
any bit of a break,

120
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,810
you're gonna give me,

121
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,630
let's say, I promise
has been so, so much.

122
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,910
You're going to give me
a dollar 20th services

123
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,650
for every dollar I spend, right?

124
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,689
And then from a
procurement perspective,

125
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:04,040
even beyond that, that,

126
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,365
that commitment retirement,

127
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:08,405
which we'll see here
in a second too,

128
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:10,520
is that you get
everything on one bill.

129
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,030
So you see your rows
usage right next

130
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,960
to all the underlying EC2
network and storage, right?

131
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,245
And this experience,
as we've already seen,

132
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:23,900
major, major leap forward

133
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,595
in terms of how
customers are using it.

134
00:05:25,595 --> 00:05:27,290
For example, we'll
call one customer

135
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,750
financial services customer that

136
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,880
got into rows a self-service

137
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,210
because of the technical
self-service aspect of it.

138
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,630
Has the financial aspect of it.

139
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,190
They weren't even a
customer Red Hat.

140
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,765
They got into it this summer.

141
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:40,310
And now with a little help from

142
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,635
our Black Belt customer
success teams.

143
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:45,845
They're the number one
consumer of Rosa on

144
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,920
a ARR basis, which is huge.

145
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,005
All right, so let's check
this out a little bit, right?

146
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:55,895
I want to walk through what

147
00:05:55,895 --> 00:05:59,045
Rosa self-service
install looks like.

148
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:01,670
So we're going to go to good,

149
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,170
use the AWS CLI
and the Rosa CLI,

150
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,880
which is the four.

151
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,485
Whereas AWS CLI is what

152
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:11,720
most Amazon users and

153
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,300
administrators use to
STI and HIV services,

154
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,305
configure their
environment, etc.

155
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:17,920
All right, and then
what we're gonna do

156
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,420
is we're going to compare

157
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,469
that to what looks
like to stand up EKS.

158
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:25,765
Not to say that Rosa an EKS

159
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,310
are even really comparison

160
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,720
because one's an
application platform,

161
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,135
the other one is
Kubernetes infrastructure.

162
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:33,250
But as I mentioned earlier,

163
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,140
like the behaviors that are that

164
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,060
these cloud providers are
trained or customers on.

165
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,805
I want to show you how similar
these experiences are.

166
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:42,730
So for me, we talk to customers.

167
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,100
Really, they're not going to
have to learn a whole lot

168
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,005
of new stuff or are

169
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:49,030
really not a whole lot
of new processes to

170
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,655
get there because to
get the clusters up.

171
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:55,015
Alright, so let's pull
up my command line here.

172
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,160
And the first thing I'm
gonna do is I'm going to log

173
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,955
into amazon USE Stu.

174
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:03,430
And this is a little
cooking show thing because

175
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,620
I've already inputted
my credentials,

176
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,195
so that's just there.

177
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:10,599
Now I'm gonna do is
Rosa create cluster.

178
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:13,030
Let me name this puppy.

179
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,175
Demo.

180
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:17,560
One. Right.

181
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,590
Now we're off to
the races, right?

182
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,470
So this will take
about 30 minutes

183
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,060
and by the time this is done,

184
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,580
I'll have a full
OpenShift cluster.

185
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,505
Ready, got Rosa cluster
ready to go on Amazon.

186
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:33,070
All right, so let's see what
the experience was like for

187
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,175
another service on Amazon,
specifically EKS, right?

188
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:40,740
So AWS Configure,
configure log in.

189
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,100
All right, Well again,

190
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,380
and now I'm going to
use what they have,

191
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,680
the AKS command
line, EKS CTL spray.

192
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,780
So just one other CLI,

193
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,990
EKS, CTL Create cluster.

194
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,850
And there is a very small change

195
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,965
in terms of the parameters.

196
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:04,805
And that is name and name is,

197
00:08:04,805 --> 00:08:11,120
we'll just say CSF will be
KS one or something, right?

198
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,675
And there we go.

199
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:12,170
Alright?

200
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,580
Now often racism will have

201
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,485
an AKS cluster of
about 20 minutes.

202
00:08:15,485 --> 00:08:18,080
All right, so one thing
I'm sure you all notice.

203
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,065
One thing we've got dinged
on a lot in the past is,

204
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:23,570
you know, how long it takes
to get a cluster up, right?

205
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,379
Well, I can tell you from
a rose at ETS perspective.

206
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,900
First of all, that was
super easy to do right?

207
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,515
In.

208
00:08:30,515 --> 00:08:32,720
And secondly, that 30
minutes is because not

209
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,970
only are you put in,
you know, Kubernetes,

210
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,980
he's out there or
a smattering on

211
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,600
all the other really
awesome value

212
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,130
out of distractions
that makes OpenShift,

213
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,100
OpenShift on top of
the cluster, right?

214
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,110
So that's, that's
very different.

215
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,670
So basically in the,

216
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,905
in the time it takes to
watch Seinfeld episode,

217
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:52,145
you can have Rosa
cluster up and you know,

218
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:55,820
our our customers or our
off to the races using it.

219
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,240
One thing usually, in my
earlier years here at Red Hat,

220
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,955
specifically with OpenShift V3,

221
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:05,135
I would always say preface,
any demo, do that.

222
00:09:05,135 --> 00:09:07,190
Customer with, boy, I hope I

223
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,470
sacrificed and
solutions architects

224
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,910
to the demo gods last night.

225
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,830
So I can have a good demo.

226
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,215
I can tell you today and now

227
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:19,565
we're turning on clusters is so easy with Rosa, an ARO.

228
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:21,155
No sacrifices needed.

229
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:23,210
I know it's going
to work every time,

230
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,040
which is totally
awesome and that is

231
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,540
the experience that
our customers are

232
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,325
expecting in the Cloud.

233
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:31,715
All right, So we went over
the technical portion, right?

234
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:32,510
The second Weber's.

235
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,105
Now let's look at
the financial part.

236
00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:40,325
So what I want to show you
here is my Amazon bill.

237
00:09:40,325 --> 00:09:44,555
It shows Rosa and all my
EC2 and it's right here.

238
00:09:44,555 --> 00:09:46,460
So as you can see in February,

239
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:52,940
I've spent about $2281
on Amazon services,

240
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,510
which includes Rosa my
apologies, the Julia accident.

241
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,090
You'll be getting this
expense report very soon.

242
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,075
We also have another really
cool view here, right?

243
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:04,850
So this is console
dot write this as

244
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,520
our Hybrid Cloud Console
for, for OpenShift.

245
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,120
That shows me all my connected
OpenShift clusters, right?

246
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,620
Ccds here, there's
some over here

247
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,720
it has CP, things like that.

248
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,540
Think of it as almost
like an ACM light.

249
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,310
What is in here is there's

250
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,310
a cost management feature
where I can actually connect

251
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,830
my console dot experience up

252
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,705
to the billing providers

253
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:28,730
of the different Cloud
providers, right?

254
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,215
So as you see here,
you have opened

255
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:31,580
that are Amazon Web Services,

256
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,560
Azure, GCP, et cetera.

257
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,540
So I am AWS connected up here.

258
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,420
I'm going to click this. And
now you see this account.

259
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,490
And what you see is
this historical data

260
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,140
in terms of my usage, right?

261
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,770
As you can see,

262
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,180
there's a little bit of
break here because I turn

263
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,410
my clusters off so it wasn't

264
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,225
being charged anything, right?

265
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:48,980
But this is a, this is
super important and

266
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,765
very cold for our
customers understand.

267
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:52,085
Because again, this removes

268
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,630
so much of the procurement and

269
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,570
the financial friction away

270
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,240
from a buying OpenShift

271
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,425
that they would
typically have for,

272
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:03,455
for self-managed,
right? All right.

273
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,345
So let's go back to the deck.

274
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:07,400
Okay, So I also

275
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,020
remember I talked about
consistency, right?

276
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,610
So consistency is key,

277
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,380
consistent openness
to experience.

278
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,510
No matter where
you choose arrive.

279
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,280
To show this, I'm going to go on

280
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,940
to advanced cluster
manager, ACM.

281
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,009
And I'm going to
launch an application,

282
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:25,130
same application across
a vSphere cluster,

283
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,020
ana Rosa cluster, right?

284
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,670
That's important in this view.

285
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,130
The sphere in
Amazon Web Services

286
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,795
are wildly different
infrastructure.

287
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:34,160
But again, that value add,

288
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,810
that value proposition of,

289
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,015
of OpenShift is that
consistent experience

290
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:40,070
that really abstracts
away that complexity.

291
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,810
You heard me talk
before, you heard me say

292
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,610
this and enzymes, but
I'll say it again.

293
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,485
The value proposition of

294
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:47,540
OpenShift is that we unlock

295
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,715
the power of containers and
cube well hiding their,

296
00:11:49,715 --> 00:11:52,730
hiding their complexity, which
includes airline emperor.

297
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,810
So hurry up.

298
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,535
I will add a label.

299
00:11:55,535 --> 00:11:57,830
It's called Book of a
very simple, right?

300
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,030
And there is an application

301
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,290
catalog that, that's
associated with.

302
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,405
So that's a V sqrt cluster.

303
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:05,510
And I'll just add one to
one of my Rosa clusters.

304
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,710
I stood up previously that

305
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,200
touched again cooking
shows to help.

306
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,435
All right. Now if I look at
the application catalog here,

307
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:20,270
I will go find that
book info application.

308
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,620
And here you see

309
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,930
the architecture or the topology

310
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,895
or other of that application.

311
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:27,710
Just to prove to
you that this was

312
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,570
not some sort of
slide where vapor,

313
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,850
I will now show you that,
hey, I'm actually running.

314
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,710
So this is that
application running on

315
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,420
vSphere and use

316
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,535
that exact same application
running on Rosa.

317
00:12:37,535 --> 00:12:39,695
Totally awesome,
consistent experience.

318
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:42,035
If I had multiple teams
out there working on this,

319
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:43,940
one wouldn't have to be
trained and vSphere,

320
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,050
another one won't
have to be trained

321
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,150
and an amine Amazon, again,

322
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,550
Oba shift just kind of a
lock step for them and

323
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,355
locks the power of technology
is like container and cube.

324
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,450
To get your applications

325
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,620
out there as quickly
as possible,

326
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,095
I get while hiding the
underlying complexity.

327
00:12:57,095 --> 00:12:59,195
All right, next slide.

328
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,320
Okay.

329
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,935
So one of the things
that I'll close with

330
00:13:03,935 --> 00:13:05,720
is something that is super

331
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,505
important for
customers understand.

332
00:13:07,505 --> 00:13:09,170
And that is the Red Hat Site

333
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,645
Reliability Engineering
or SRE team.

334
00:13:11,645 --> 00:13:14,585
These are experts that manage

335
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,090
our managed OpenShift clusters

336
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,500
are Cloud services
for that matter,

337
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,000
all of them behind
the scenes, right?

338
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,830
In, Let's be honest
with ourselves here,

339
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,520
there's no one better out
there to, to operate.

340
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,635
Red Hat Cloud
services are read at

341
00:13:27,635 --> 00:13:30,605
Red Hat Software than red
adders themselves, right?

342
00:13:30,605 --> 00:13:32,195
Is a set of product engineers,

343
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:34,625
systems engineers, the
intersection of that right?

344
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:38,195
They began to become basically
a virtual team member

345
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:41,315
of your customers
operations and SRE teams.

346
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:42,950
This is super
important in terms of

347
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,589
lowering the total
cost of ownership.

348
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:47,780
So that the customers can then

349
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,060
focus the resources on
what really matters.

350
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,920
And that's delivering
applications.

351
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,230
This is the say that
with our SRE team,

352
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,580
we're enabling our customers

353
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,840
the resiliency of the platform.

354
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,300
We continuous uptime
to move from 24,

355
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,780
7 operations to 95 innovations.

356
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,310
And that 95 innovations,

357
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,010
which is helping customers
deliver applications to prod,

358
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,545
breaking the land
speed record, right?

359
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:11,780
That is what drives
consumption from

360
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,570
a selling perspective that
is hypercritical or Red Hat.

361
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,740
And this is again,
another reason

362
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,200
why we love Cloud services.

363
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,025
All right.

364
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,540
I think it's back to James

365
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,250
to her application
modernization.

366
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,610
Thank you.
